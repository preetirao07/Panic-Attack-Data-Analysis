# Panic-Attack-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes a Panic Attack Dataset using a complete data pipeline—from ingestion and cleaning in Snakeflow (SQL workspace) to building a multi-page Power BI report. The goal was to clean the dataset, prepare analytical features, and build an interactive dashboard to uncover patterns in age groups, symptoms, triggers, and attack frequency.
